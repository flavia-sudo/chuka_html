<h2><b>Example Cafe Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</b></h2><br/>
I adopted this recipe from a book called <font color="blue"><i><u>Sydney Food</i></u></font> by Bill Grainger. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in<br/>Kings Cross, Sydney, I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the <i>best</i> scrambled eggs I have<br/>ever tasted.<br/>
&nbsp;<br/>
This recipe is what I call a "very special breakfast"; just look at the ingredients to see why. It has to be tasted to be believed.<br/>
<h3><b>Ingredients</b></h3><br/>
The following ingredients make one serving:<br/>
<ul type="dot">
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of butter (10g)</li>
<li>1/3 cup of cream (2 3/4 fl ounces)</li>
<li>A pinch of salt</li>
<li>Freshly milled black pepper</li>
<li>3 fresh chives (chopped)</li></ul>
<h3><b>Instructions</b></h3><br/>
<ol type="1">
<li>Whisk eggs, cream, and salt in a bowl.</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat (taking care not to burn the butter).</li>
<li>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts setting around the edge of the pan (around 20 seconds).</li>
<li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet, and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
<li>Fold contents in again, leave for 20 seconds, and repeat until the eggs are only just done.</li>
<li>Grind a light sprinkling of freshly milled pepper over the eggs and blend in some chopped fresh chives.</li></ol>
You should only make a <b>maximum</b> of two servings per frying pan.
